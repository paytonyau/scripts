## This script calculates the probability of >1 event occurring given different
## average event frequencies of occurrence (using a Poisson PDF).
## The application is to understand the impact of MOI (ratio of viruses:bacteria)
## on the probability of co-infection.

# The above makes an important assumption: the mean number of infections per
# bacterium is assumed to be equal to the MOI (and is therefore the mean (Î») of
# the Poisson distribution). In other words:
# - all bacteria are equally likely to be infected
# - every virus present will go on to infect a bacterium
#
# These assumptions are unlikely to be strictly true and remember that if a
# bacterium is infected by 2 or more phage, they are not necessarily different
# genotypes. This depends on the proportions of different phage as well.
#
# More precisely: if there are two types of phage (A and B) in equal proportion
# (50:50) and there are n phage infecting a bacterium then the probabilities are:
# - P(all type A) = (1/2) ^ n
# - P(all type B) = (1/2) ^ n
# - P(all type A or B) = 2 * (1/2) ^ n
# - P(not all one type) = 1 - ( 2 * (1/2) ^ n )
#
# = 0, 0.5, 0.75, 0.875, 0.9375... for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
#
# The next graph multiplies these probabilities by the Poisson ones and sums
# (up to arbitrarily large values of n). Yes, I know some maths could probably
# be done but this works too.
