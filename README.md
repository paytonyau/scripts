# Scripts Repository
This repo contains a set of scripts I have created for use in teaching and research.

## Klepto_GLM.R
This script was generated for sequential Generalized Linear Modelling in [this publication](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00063657.2016.1249821) in the journal Bird Study. The script and input data are also available on the [lead author's FigShare](https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.4047558.v1).

## Poisson.R
This script generates expected frequencies of multiple viral infection and co-infection under various assumptions and given specified multiplicities of infection (MOIs).
